at &ldquo;Tips for Easier Sewing,&rdquo; <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>. They
will aid you in improving your sewing.</p>
<h4>What to study</h4>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Care of clothing&mdash;learn to keep your clothing in its proper place.</dt>
<dt>2. Buying anklets and how to care for them.</dt>
<dt>3. Habits to improve health and grooming.</dt>
<dt>4. Style, material, and construction of easy-to-make clothes for school and play.</dt>
<dt>5. Taking part in special events such as judging, demonstrations, and exhibits.</dt></dl>
<h4>Articles to make</h4>
<p>Make one of these articles:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Swimming robe</dt>
<dt>Scarf</dt>
<dt>Peasant apron</dt>
<dt>Draw-string bag</dt></dl>
<p>This will help you review what you
learned in the other projects and to get the
feel of using the sewing machine.</p>
<p>Make one of these articles:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>School dress</dt>
<dt>Skirt and blouse</dt></dl>
<h4>Add to your 4-H record book</h4>
<p>Your county extension agent will give
you a clothing record sheet and a sheet for
your 4-H Club story for this year. Place
them in front of last years&rsquo; records. Keep
your records as you go. You may record
the articles you make other than those that
are required for your project, unless you have
made them for some other program or class.
Keep a record of the activities you participate
in (such as tours, demonstrations, judging,
camps, and exhibits) for your permanent
record.</p>
<h4>Demonstrate to your club</h4>
<p>Give a demonstration at one of your
club meetings. Show others what you have
learned. When you show another club member
how to tie a knot or sew on a button,
you are giving a &ldquo;demonstration.&rdquo; Things
that are done or seen are remembered longest
and clearest. Work alone or with a partner.
Plan to enter a community or county demonstration
contest. Ask your leader for help
on how to give a demonstration. Choose a
topic you will study in your project.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Plan your project</span></h2>
<p>You will have fun making and buying
clothing for school or play. Plan this
project with your leader and your mother.
Remember that mother is a partner in this
project. Talk to her about what you want to
make and show her this project book. She
will be glad to give you suggestions and help
you make a wise selection if she knows what
you are to make.</p>
<p>First you will study how to buy and care
for your anklets.</p>
<p>The first article you will make is to help
you review what you learned in your last
project and to help you get the feel of the
sewing machine again. There is a wide
choice&mdash;select something that you can make
in a short time. Complete this article before
you start your dress or skirt and blouse.</p>
<p>The second article is to be the main part
of your project. Here you will learn many
new sewing methods. Select something you
have not made before. Choose something that
will teach you two or three new tricks in
sewing, but be careful to avoid dresses with
many details such as collars, cuffs, and
sleeves on one pattern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h3 id="c3">Your anklets</h3>
<h4>Buying anklets</h4>
<p>It is important that you learn to select
your own clothing. Why not start with buying
your anklets? You will wear anklets for
many occasions&mdash;sports, school, and best.
Select them for the occasion for which you
intend to wear them.</p>
<p>You will find anklets made of many fibers&mdash;cotton,
rayon, nylon, wool, or a combination
of these fibers. Each of these fibers
makes the anklets feel and wear differently.
Cotton anklets are soft and absorbent. They
are comfortable to wear. A good quality
cotton anklet holds its shape and wears well.</p>
<p>Rayon anklets are not as soft or as absorbent
as cotton and may not wear as well.
Nylon anklets are made of staple yarn (silk-like)
and of spun yarn (wool-like). They
give long wear but are not as comfortable as
cotton. This is because they are not as absorbent.
Wool socks are usually worn by
athletes and people whose feet perspire a
lot, because they are absorbent. They will
hold a lot of moisture and not feel wet.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="{anklets}" width="446" height="316" />
</div>
<h4>Read the labels</h4>
<p>A combination of cotton and nylon makes
a desirable anklet. You will find anklets
made of cotton with toes and heels reinforced
with nylon for longer wear. Blends
of nylon and cotton or other fibers are also
used. Anklets are made of many new and
different kinds of yarns and knits to add patterns
and stretch. New finishes are also used.
Some finishes help to hold the shape and
control shrinkage. The finish may require
special care and washing.</p>
<p>A good anklet is closely knit, has a top
which will hold its shape, and the cuff is
knitted to the foot. It comes in colors which
harmonize with your dresses or sweaters and
skirts. It is &ldquo;fast color&rdquo; and will not fade.</p>
<h4>Buy the right size anklets</h4>
<p>To be comfortable anklets should be one
half inch longer than your foot. Short socks
are injurious to your feet. They do not wear
as long as properly-fitted ones.</p>
<p>Visit your store to study the newest types
of socks for teenagers.</p>
<h4>Care of anklets</h4>
<p>Good care will help your anklets to last
longer. Wash your socks after each wearing.
Use a mild soap or detergent and warm
water. Have the water as hot as you can
comfortably hold your hands in. Rinse the
socks thoroughly in clear water and hang
them by the toes to dry. White socks may
be washed with the family laundry. Always
wash dark-colored ones by hand.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Improve your grooming</span></h2>
<h3 id="c5">Care of your hair</h3>
<p>Study the care of your hair for your
good grooming lesson. Learn to comb,
brush, shampoo, and arrange it. Invite the
beautician or hair dresser in your community
to talk at a club meeting. She will be glad to
show you how to care for and style your hair.
Have her show you how to make pincurls,
waves, or rolls.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="Hairdo" width="253" height="372" />
</div>
<p>Shiny, clean-looking hair adds to your
good looks. It shows the condition of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
health. Poor health, lack of rest, or poor food
can make your hair look dull. But more
often, dull hair is due to lack of care. You
can add to the luster of your hair by shampooing
it often. Brushing will also add to
its beauty.</p>
<h4>Shampoo</h4>
<p>The base of any good hair style is a good
shampoo. There is no set time for a shampoo.
Shampoo your hair when it is soiled.
You may want to shampoo it every five days
if your hair is oily. Every week may be often
enough if it is dry.</p>
<p>Use plenty of warm water and a good
shampoo when you wash your hair. Shampoos
are made for oily, normal, and dry hair.
Ask the beautician which one is best for your
hair. Rinse thoroughly to remove the shampoo
and to add luster to your hair.</p>
<h4>Style</h4>
<p>Since your hair is a frame for your face,
a nice arrangement adds to your good looks.
Hair worn in a simple style is easy to manage.
Good hair styling is important. If your
hair is shaped properly, it will take the shape
of the cut. Your hair styling will then be
beautiful and becoming.</p>
<p>Here is a trick for finding your hair style.
When your hair is wet, mold it around your
face and try several parts. Try curving your
part. It is more interesting than a straight
one. Always bring out your beauty spots.
If you have a beautiful hair line, display it.</p>
<p>Hair is styled for the individual. Try new
hair styles. There are many designed for
girls your age.</p>
<h4>Brush and comb</h4>
<p>Brush your hair regularly with a boar-bristle
brush for stimulation and to cleanse
your hair. Brush your hair carefully. Too
vigorous brushing may break the ends of
your hair. The same is true of combing.</p>
<p>Set your hair in pincurls as often as is
necessary to have your hair look well-groomed.
Comb your hair thoroughly when
it is dry. Set the waves or curls by combing
through the hair slowly. This gives you control
of your hair.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Patterns for you</span></h2>
<p>There are many attractive clothing
patterns in our current fashion books.
Choose a style you like and feel you can
make. Be sure it has lines that are becoming
to your figure and size. You may need a style
that is entirely different from the one your
girl friend needs. Your mother and leader
will be glad to help you make a choice. This
is probably the first time you have used a pattern.
Select one that has only a few pieces.
Avoid details such as collars, set-in sleeves,
and yokes. Select a pattern you can wear
to school.</p>
<p>The size pattern you will need is determined
by your bust measurement.</p>
<p>After you have selected your pattern,
study the chart on the back of the envelope.
It will tell you how much fabric you need
and what trimmings to buy. Buy your pattern
and fabric at the same time.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02d.jpg" alt="Measurements for fitting" width="269" height="440" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Fabrics you will like</span></h2>
<p>When you select your fabric, the important
thing to think about is: What
am I going to make from this fabric? When
and where will I wear it? Then choose the
right design, color, and weight for your
pattern.</p>
<p>You will want fabrics that are pretty, fun
to sew, and fun to wear.</p>
<h4>Color</h4>
<p>What colors do you like best? Usually the
colors you like are the ones that flatter you.
Hold the fabric to your face to see how you
will look in it. Does it make your hair, eyes,
and skin look prettier? Will it go with other
colors of the clothing you already own? Is
it a color you can wear to school this fall?
Is it a color you can find thread and trimming
to match? It is the color for you if it
meets all these requirements.</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>Study the fabrics for the size, color, and
placing of the design in the fabric. Do you
want to count the number of spots on it?
Is the design too large or too small? A design
that is small with interesting colors
without one part of the design being brighter
than all others will make the prettier dress
or apron.</p>
<p>Larger, brighter, and bolder designs and
colors make attractive beach robes and bags.
You will find it more difficult to make an
attractive dress or apron from plain colors,
plaids, and stripes. Plain colors show every
mistake you make and plaids and stripes are
difficult to match. Border prints are used for
pleated or gathered skirts. Try to match the
design at the seams.</p>
<p>Cotton fabrics are beautiful and there are
many types of fabrics made from cotton.
Learn to recognize at least five: Percale,
broadcloth, sail cloth, cotton satin, and terry
cloth. There are many interesting novelty
fabrics on the market. They have different
weaves and finishes. When you visit the store
see if you can find at least three novelty
fabrics&mdash;embossed cotton, woven stripes, and
a pattern weave.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="366" />
<p class="pcap">I KNOW THESE FABRICS&mdash;DO YOU?</p>
</div>
<h4>New finishes</h4>
<p>New finishes make cottons more crease
resistant and easier to wash and iron. But
finishes sometimes make fabrics harder to
sew and press. You will find a finished cotton
will make a crisper looking dress and
will be worth the extra work it takes to press
the seams while you are making it.</p>
<h4>Labels</h4>
<p>Read the information on the label on the
end of the bolt. It will tell you if the fabric
is color fast, shrink resistant, crease resistant,
and either hand-or-machine washable. A good
cotton fabric has all these features.</p>
<h4>Examine the fabric</h4>
<p>Examine a torn end of the fabric. If the
ends and designs are uneven, look for another
piece of fabric. An uneven fabric with a finish
cannot be straightened and you will not be
able to cut your dress on the straight of the
grain. Crush the fabric in your hand. Select
one that is soft and difficult to wrinkle.</p>
<h4>Tours</h4>
<p>Plan a shopping tour with your club. Take
your mother with you so she can help you
select fabrics for your projects.</p>
<p>Select all the fabrics you need for your
project at one time. Choose colors and fabrics
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
that look good together. Remember that you
will be wearing your blouse with your skirt
so they must look well together. The bag or
scarf you make must also harmonize with
your skirt and blouse or your other clothes.</p>
<p>Also think about the time you will finish
your dress and select a style and color that
will be pretty then.</p>
<h4>Shopping is fun</h4>
<p>Before you go shopping, make a list of all
the things you will need to buy for your
project&mdash;equipment, fabrics, thread. If you
did not have a tracing wheel and paper last
year, you may need them this year. Make
it a habit to buy everything you need in one
trip to the store.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">Before you start to sew</span></h2>
<h3 id="c9">Study your pattern</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03b.jpg" alt="Studying pattern" width="215" height="270" />
</div>
<p>Study the instruction sheet carefully
before you unfold your pattern. This will
help you know each piece of your pattern
as you unfold it. When unfolding it, put
your initials on each piece.</p>
<p>You will find an arrow on each piece of
the pattern that tells you how the pattern
is to be placed on your cloth. This mark is
called the &ldquo;grain line.&rdquo; Learn to recognize
marks for fold, seamline, darts, tucks, hems,
center front and center back, buttons, and
buttonholes.</p>
<p>When you can recognize all the marks on
your pattern, trim off the edges and pin it
together. Have your leader check it for fit.
She will help you make any alterations that
are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Straighten your fabric</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03c.jpg" alt="Straight fabric" width="469" height="194" />
</div>
<p>Study your fabric. You will find there are
threads running lengthwise (warp threads)
with other threads woven in and out of these
(crosswise or filling threads). Each of these
threads should be straight, not curved or
slanted. If the end of the fabric has not
been torn, pull one thread near the end that
will go all the way across the fabric. Cut
along this line.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03d.jpg" alt="Pulled thread" width="488" height="155" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="Pulling on the bias" width="294" height="258" />
</div>
<p>Now if the ends of the fabric are not even,
have your leader or mother help you
straighten the cloth by pulling on the bias,
as is being done in the picture.</p>
<p>When the cloth is straight, pin the edges
together. Now pin the pattern to your cloth.</p>
<p>Crease-resistant fabric cannot be straightened.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Pin and cut</h3>
<p>You need a large smooth surface for pinning
and cutting. A big table is best, but
you can use a clean floor.</p>
<p>Study your pattern layout. Fold your
cloth and pin your pattern as suggested.
Place the big pattern pieces on first. See
that the line that shows the straight of the
grain is placed exactly on the lengthwise
&ldquo;grain&rdquo; or thread of the cloth.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="Pattern placed on fabric" width="463" height="275" />
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>SELVAGE</dt>
<dt>STRAIGHT OF GRAIN</dt></dl>
<p>Measure from the selvage to this line,
making sure the distance is equal at all
points. Pin at each end of mark as measurements
are made. Now pin around the edge
of your pattern. Place the pins at right angles
to the edge.</p>
<p>Have your leader check the pattern on
your cloth before you cut.</p>
<p>Use long sharp shears. Take long strokes
to give an even edge. Cut close to the pattern.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="Cutting pattern" width="474" height="276" />
</div>
<p>Cut notches out, not into your seam
allowance.</p>
<p>Before you remove the pattern, mark all
darts, tucks, seams, buttons, and buttonholes.
Ask your leader to show you how to make
tailor&rsquo;s tacks or how to use dressmakers&rsquo; tracing
paper. Use the lightest-colored paper
that will show on your cloth. <a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a> tells
you more about guide lines.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Check your machine</h3>
<p>Before you start to sew, check the machine
stitch. Your seams will not hold if the stitch
is not perfect. Try your machine stitch on
a double piece of cloth. Stitch on the bias
and the straight. Does the stitch look the
same on both sides? If not, have your leader
adjust the tension while you watch to see
how she does it.</p>
<p>For a review of what you learned about
the sewing machine in your other projects,
practice sewing on a sample of your fabric
until you get the feel of the machine. When
you can run the machine smoothly, make one
of the following articles for practice&mdash;scarf,
draw-string bag, apron, or swimming robe.</p>
<h4>Cloth guide</h4>
<p>A cloth guide on your machine will aid
in making the stitching straight. Place a strip
of colored scotch tape on the machine &#8541; inch,
or the width desired, from the needle if a
gauge is not available. Keep the edge of the
cloth along the inside of the tape or guide
as you sew. Watch the edge of the tape not
the machine needle.</p>
<p>The pressure foot is a good gauge for edge
stitching. It is easy to stitch close to the
edge of a hem if you let the edge of the cloth
follow the inside of the presser foot. A &#8539; inch
seam can be made by letting the edge follow
the outside of the presser foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">Practice on an easy-to-make article</span></h2>
<h3 id="c14">Draw-string bag</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04f.jpg" alt="Draw-string bag" width="370" height="267" />
</div>
<p>You may make a draw-string bag to
review what you learned last year. This
may be any size. It can be used for your
sewing, swimming suit, as a hand bag, or for
many other purposes.</p>
<h4>Materials needed</h4>
<p><i>Fabric</i>: Percale, sail cloth, denim, terry
cloth, or towel. If you use a towel, select
one approximately 14 x 23 or 18 x 28.</p>
<p><i>Lining</i>: Plastic bag.</p>
<p><i>Cording</i>: Cotton or nylon cording.</p>
<h4>Make your bag</h4>
<p>First decide how long and how wide you
would like to have your bag. Make it just
large enough for the purpose you plan to
use it for. Don&rsquo;t make it too large.</p>
<h4>Follow these suggestions</h4>
<p>1. Pull threads to straighten material and
cut on these lines.</p>
<p>2. Cut two pieces of cloth for the bag,
the size you want your bag to be. If you have
enough cloth, you may cut one piece twice
as long and eliminate the bottom seam. When
a towel is used, remove the hems at both
ends.</p>
<p>3. Place the two pieces with right sides
together or fold through the center if one
piece is used.</p>
<p>4. Pin or baste sides leaving the top open.</p>
<p>5. Measure from the top or open end of
the bag &frac12;-inch and mark with chalk.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04g.jpg" alt="Bag pattern" width="447" height="250" />
</div>
<p>6. Take another measurement from the
top, this one 4 inches down and mark.</p>
<p>7. Stitch a &frac12;-inch seam from top to first
mark, and fasten or back tack thread. Stitch
below second markings. Leave the space between
markings open on both sides of bag.</p>
<p>8. Make a &frac14;-inch slash in the seam at
lower markings and finish openings with &frac12;-inch
hems.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04h.jpg" alt="Hemming the bag" width="443" height="157" />
</div>
<p>9. Make a 2-inch hem at top. Stitch
through the center of the hem to make a
1-inch wide casing and heading. If you are
making a swimming bag, why not line it with
plastic. Either use a sheet or plastic bag.
Make it the same size as your bag.</p>
<p>At this point place the plastic under the
hem. Pin or baste into position. Turn right
side out. Stitch hem. Use long stitches 6 or
8 to an inch when sewing plastic. Small
stitches will cut it.</p>
<p>10. Make or buy the cords for your bag.
Make two cords &frac34; inch wide finished, 1 yard
each in length. (See apron sashes&mdash;Phase 2.)
You may buy cotton or nylon cord. For a
small bag use size 100; use size 150 for a
large bag.</p>
<p>11. Run cords through casing. Start each
cord at opposite ends. Sew ends of cord
together or tie a knot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Stitching the bag" width="376" height="236" />

<p>12. Box the bottom of the bag. Fold from
corner so that side and bottom seams are together.
Mark and stitch across triangle.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Swimming robe</h3>
<div class="img">

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>TIE or BUTTONS AND LOOP</dt>
<dt>ELASTIC or DRAW STRING</dt></dl>
<p>Swimming is now a popular sport in Oregon
so you may want to make a swimming
robe.</p>
<p>You may make one like the one pictured
or select an easy-to-make pattern from your
favorite pattern book. Or, adapt an overblouse
pattern. Just cut it long enough to
cover your swim suit.</p>
<p>Here is an easy one to make. It is mostly
hems.</p>
<p><i>Fabric</i>: Approximately 1&#8532; yards of terry
cloth, sail cloth, percale, denim, or other absorbent
cotton.</p>
<h4>How to cut</h4>
<p>1. Fold fabric in half lengthwise.</p>
<p>2. Measure in from cut end 17 inches and
mark.</p>
<div class="img">

<dt>SELVAGE</dt></dl>
<p>3. Measure down from top 12 inches to
mark arm hole. Then measure across end 2
inches on each side of mark. Cut along these
marks. This marks the top of the side dart.</p>
<p>4. Mark dart. Measure 4 inches from bottom
and mark. Then mark from this point to
top ends of dart. (See diagram.) Make final
marks for darts with tailor&rsquo;s tacks or dressmakers&rsquo;
tracing paper.</p>
<h4>How to Make</h4>
<p>1. Fold robe through dart and armhole.
Pin and stitch shoulder seams. Make shoulder
10&frac12; inches long. Measure from arm hole.
Make a 2-inch seam.</p>
<p>2. Pin underarm dart&mdash;2 inches wide at
underarm and slope to a point 4 inches from
bottom. Stitch. (See darts <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.)</p>
<p>3. Press a 1&frac12;-inch hem all around robe including
shoulder seams and armholes (see
phase 1). To make hem turn edge back 2
inches and press, then press &frac12; inch under to
make 1&frac12; inch hem.</p>

<p>If you have completed and judged your
small article, you are ready to start your
main article. You may make a skirt and
blouse, or a dress. You talked this over with
your mother and leader at your first meeting.
By now you should have your fabric and
pattern and all the other things you will need
to make your chosen article.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Easy-to-make blouse</h3>
<p>If you make a blouse, select a pattern
which will be easy to make. Choose a pattern
with few pieces and without set-in
sleeves or collar.</p>
<p>Follow the directions in your pattern for
making your blouse. Learn what all the
markings mean. Stay-stitch the bias edges.
<a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a> tells you how to stay-stitch.</p>
<p>Select cloth for your blouse that will look
good with your skirt. Be sure the cloth is
firm, pre-shrunk, and colorfast.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Gathered skirt</h3>
<p>Select fabric that is colorful and gay for
your skirt. Closely woven cloth will be easy
to sew and will hold a sharp crease.</p>
<p>You will need from 3 to 3&frac12; yards of fabric
for your skirt. The more fabric you try to
gather in your skirt the harder it will be to
make. For the girl of average height cut
your skirt as follows:</p>
<h4>How to cut your skirt</h4>
<p>Cut or tear a 6&frac12;-inch strip from one side
of your skirt fabric. Measure in from the
selvage edge. Use this for the skirt band
and pockets. There will be some left over.</p>
<p>Tear off the selvage edge from the large
piece.</p>
<p>You may have to cut the band from the
end of your fabric instead of the side if you
are tall and need the extra length.</p>
<p>The above method of cutting gives you
one seam on the placket side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<div class="img">

<dt>CUT OR TEAR</dt>
<dt>SELVAGE</dt></dl>
<p>Sometimes the design in the fabric will be
more attractive if the skirt is cut in several
lengths. When this is necessary, you will
have three or four seams in your skirt. This
may make a difference in the amount of
fabric you will need, so decide how you will
cut your skirt before buying your fabric.</p>
<h4>Make your skirt</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="Pinning the seam" width="415" height="267" />
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">5&Prime;</p>
<p class="t0">1&frac14;&Prime; SEAM</p>
</div>
<p>Pin the short edges together to make the
side seam. Make the seam 1&frac14; inches wide.
It is to be used for the placket. When finished
the placket will be on the left side.</p>
<p>Stitch the side seam. Stitch the seam from
the bottom up. At a point 5 inches from the
top, turn and stitch half way across the seam.
Turn both edges of the seam toward the
front section and press.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06b.jpg" alt="Stitching the seam" width="415" height="312" />
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">5&Prime;</p>
<p class="t0">TRIM TO &#8541;&Prime;</p>
</div>
<p>Trim the seams. Start at the bottom of
the wide seam and trim it to &#8541; inch wide up
to the placket. Do not trim above this point.</p>
<h4><span id="xx1">Finish the placket</span></h4>
<p>1. Baste and stitch a &frac14;-inch hem on the
back edge of the placket.</p>
<div class="img">

<h4>Hem the skirt</h4>
<p>Skirts look best with hand-stitched hems.
Make the hem before placing the band on the
skirt. Unless you have poor posture, it will
hang even. Decide how long you would like
your finished skirt to be. Be careful not to
make it too short. Measure from the top edge
to the length you would like the skirt to be
and press in the hem. Turn the top edge of
the hem under &frac12; inch. Your skirt will be prettier
if you make a wide hem&mdash;3 inches or
wider.</p>
<p>When the hem has been carefully pressed
and put in place, ask your leader to show
you a hand hemming stitch.</p>
<h4><span id="xx3">Place gathering threads at top of skirt</span></h4>
<p>Make a long stitch on your machine. Use
size 50 top thread and heavy duty for bobbin
thread.</p>
<p>Using the guide on your machine, stitch
around the top of your skirt &frac14; inch from the
edge. Make two more rows &frac14; inch apart.
You are now ready to make your skirt band.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06f.jpg" alt="Skirt band" width="399" height="199" />
</div>
<h4><span id="xx2">Make the skirt band</span></h4>
<p>1. Measure your waist. Add 2&frac12; inches.
This will give you the length needed for your
skirt band. Cut your band 6&frac12; inches wide.</p>
<p>2. Press a &frac12;-inch fold along one side of
your band. From the folded edge divide the
rest into three sections. This gives three
2-inch sections. Make the section with the
&frac12;-inch fold slightly shorter than the other
two sections. Press.</p>
<p>3. The section with the &frac12;-inch fold is the
front of your band. Stitch criss-cross through
the back part of the band. You can stitch
straighter if you make a guide or pattern.
Cut a strip of waxed paper the length and
width of your band, 24 x 2 inches.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06g.jpg" alt="Folded waxed paper" width="459" height="96" />
</div>
<p>Fold it in six equal sections. Then fold
it diagonally; then diagonally again. Open
the paper and pin it to the band and follow
the creases in the paper. This will give practice
on starting and stopping the machine
and on turning corners. Tear the paper away
after the stitching is completed.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06h.jpg" alt="Stitching the seam" width="460" height="176" />
</div>
<p>4. Stitch a &frac12;-inch seam at the ends of
the band. Turn and press. Do not sew the
&frac12;-inch fold at bottom of band into the seam.</p>
<h4>Gather in fullness</h4>
<p>Divide both your skirt and the skirt band
into eight equal parts to help you make the
gathers even in your skirt. Do not include
the placket or 1-inch overlap at the end of
the band. Mark with colored threads. Mark
the skirt band so the extension or extra
length will be on the back of the placket.
The front of band will be even with the front
edge of the placket.</p>
<p>Pin and stitch band to skirt.</p>
<p>Pin the pieces together, right side of skirt
to right side of band. Match dividing marks
that you have made. Gently pull on the
gathering threads at the side seams, the center
front and the center back. Pull the threads
until they are the same length as the band.
Work with the gathers until they are even.
Baste and stitch along half-inch fold on the
skirt band.</p>
<h4>Top stitch the band</h4>
<p>Fold the double section of your band
toward the back and baste the edge of the
band to the skirt. Baste it so the folded edge
hangs just below the stitching you just made
on the front side of the band. Machine stitch
from the front side of the band. Place the
stitching as near the edge of the band as you
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
can. Press before you stitch. Pressing will
flatten the seam and make stitching easier.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Finished skirt" width="492" height="386" />
</div>
<h4>Press your skirt</h4>
<p>Press your skirt. Use a dampened cheesecloth
and an iron set for ironing cotton, or
use a steam iron. A skirt must be well
pressed and fresh looking to be pretty.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<h4>Fastenings for the skirt</h4>
<p>See Phase 2.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Gored skirt</h3>
<p>You may make a four-gored skirt. If you
do, you will need a pattern. Follow the instructions
on the guide sheet.</p>
<h3 id="c21">School dress</h3>
<p>This is your first dress. Avoid set-in
sleeves, collars, yokes, and gussets. Use cotton fabrics.
Study the instruction sheet in
your pattern and follow it as closely as you
can. Know what every mark on the pattern
means before you start to sew. This will
make it easier for you.</p>
<p>Pin your cloth so it is straight. Place the
pattern on the &ldquo;straight of the grain&rdquo; and
cut with long, even strokes. Cut all the
notches pointing out.</p>
<p>After the cloth is cut, transfer the marks
onto the fabric before removing the pattern.
Use a tracing wheel whenever possible. Use
tailor&rsquo;s tacks on white or pastel colors.</p>
<p>Stay-stitch around all the bias and curved
edges as soon as you remove the pattern.</p>
<p>Remember to press as you sew. Press each
seam as it is made. Pressing makes sewing
easier and improves the looks of your dress.</p>
<p>Hem your dress on the sewing machine if
it has a full gathered skirt or by hand on
flared or straight skirts or on plain colored
fabric. Use a matching thread.</p>

</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>CLOTH</dt>
<dt>TRACING PAPER</dt>
<dt>PATTERN</dt></dl>
<p>It takes very little time to trace the
markings for darts, seams, and buttonholes
from the pattern on the fabric if dressmakers&rsquo;
carbon and a tracing wheel are used.
Trace the markings while the pattern is still
pinned to the fabric. Place the carbon waxed
side to wrong side of fabric. Both sides may
be marked at the same time. Use white or
light-colored paper wherever possible. Dark
colors have a tendency to work through to
the right side. Trace all pattern markings
that are essential to making the dress&mdash;darts,
notches, pleats, openings, and buttonholes.
Use a ruler to trace straight lines. Make a
bar at ends of darts and tucks. Use tailor&rsquo;s
tacks for white or pastel fabrics.</p>
<h3 id="xc2">Tailor&rsquo;s tacks</h3>

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>SEAM LINE</dt>
<dt>CLIP THROUGH LOOP</dt>
<dt>SHORTEN ENDS</dt></dl>
<p>Use double thread of darning cotton to
make tailor&rsquo;s tacks.</p>
<p>Before taking your first stitch make a
hole in the pattern with the point of your
needle. Take one stitch through pattern and
double thickness of fabric, then go over with
another stitch, leaving loop and long end.</p>
<p>After all marked stitches have been made,
remove pattern, separate fabric carefully, and
clip threads between the two layers of fabric.</p>
<h3 id="xc3">Stay-stitch the bias edges</h3>
<p>One of the most important steps you take
to keep the cloth from stretching out of
shape is to stay-stitch the edges. Stitch along
the curved and bias edges. These edges would
be the neck, shoulders, waist, armscye, and
upper hip line. Stay-stitching is done on each
piece separately, through a single thickness.
Stitch &frac12; inch from the edge of the cloth, or &#8539;
inch from seamline.</p>

<h3 id="xc4">Pin and sew darts</h3>
<p>The purpose of the dart is to shape the
fabric to the body. After the dart is properly
marked, pin the two markings together and
stitch from the large end of the dart to the
point. Near the point, guide the fabric so
that the stitches will be only a thread or two
from the edge of the fold. Fasten the threads
by back stitching or by tying the threads.</p>
<p>Sew from the highest to the lowest point
or from the widest to the narrowest point,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
as shown by arrows on the diagrams to prevent
stretching during stitching.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="Cutting a dart" width="265" height="347" />
</div>
<h3 id="xc5">Make strong seams</h3>
<p>The life of your clothing is determined
by the kind and quality of its seams. There
are many types of seams and seam finishes.
Each one has a special purpose.</p>
<h4>Plain seam</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08c.jpg" alt="Plain seam" width="336" height="230" />
</div>
<p>The plain seam is the most commonly
used and is the first step in making other
types of seams. The plain seam is made on
the wrong side of the garment. To make a
plain seam, place the right sides of the fabric
together. Pin and sew a seam the desired
width. This is usually &#8541; inch. Follow the
instructions in your pattern. Use this seam
on your blouse, skirt, and dress.</p>
<h3 id="xc6">Seam finishes</h3>
<p>Finishes are used on fabrics to prevent the
edges from fraying. Use one of the following
finishes:</p>
<h4>Pinked edges</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="Pinked edges" width="340" height="234" />
</div>
<p>Use pinking shears, if you are able to
handle them. Trim off only the very edge
of your seam. Be very careful.</p>
<h4>Edge stitching</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08e.jpg" alt="Edge stitching" width="329" height="229" />
</div>
<p>After the plain seam is pressed open,
machine stitch along each edge of the seam.
This is a stronger finish than the pinked
edge.</p>
<h4>Selvage</h4>
<p>The selvage may be left as a seam finish
on your skirt. Clip the selvage every 2 or 3
inches. The clip should be no deeper than
&#8539; inch. A deeper cut will ruin the seam.</p>
<p>Your seams are not complete until you
have pressed them. Remember, always press
a seam before joining it to another seam.</p>
<h3 id="xc7">Make a fitted facing</h3>
<p>Edges that cannot be hemmed may be
finished with either bias or fitted facings.
Facings can be turned to the right or wrong
side of an article. They may be part of the
decoration if used on the right side.</p>
<h4>Fitting and stitching</h4>
<p>1. Stay-stitch neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>2. Insert a basting line to mark center
front and back of the facing and blouse. Use
darning cotton.</p>
<p>3. Sew shoulder seams of blouse and
facing. Press.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>4. Press a &frac14; inch hem around the facing.
Miter the corners and stitch.</p>
<p>5. Pin facing to blouse, matching shoulder
seams and centers. Baste centers of front and
of back together.</p>
<p>6. Machine stitch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. Stitch around the neckline, &#8541; inch
seam. b. Stitch center front. Start at
point &frac14; inch from center fold, stitch to
point B. B. is almost on center fold.
Turn, take 3 small stitches (14-16/inch),
turn again, and stitch to point C, &frac14; inch
from center fold.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08f.jpg" alt="Machine-stitched blouse" width="508" height="353" />
</div>
<p>7. Cut along center fold to point B. Trim
neck seam to &frac14; inch and clip seam every
&frac12; inch.</p>
<p>8. Trim off corners at neck openings.</p>
<p>9. Turn facing and press. After facing
edge is finished, tack it to the shoulder seam
of blouse.</p>
<h4>Finishing edges</h4>
<p>If the facing is to be used for decoration,
the edge of the facing will be stitched to
the blouse or dress.</p>
<h3 id="xc8">Make good hems</h3>
<h4>Straight hems</h4>
<p>You made straight hems on your scarf and
on your apron last year. Here is a general
review on how to make a hem. If you need
more help, see your last year&rsquo;s bulletin.</p>
<h4>Narrow hems</h4>
<p>Make a fold &frac14; inch wide; press. Fold this
over and press again. Pin and stitch.</p>
<h4>Wide hems</h4>
<p>Make &frac14;-inch fold along the edge. Then
measure the width your hem is to be when
finished. Pin, press, and stitch.</p>
<h4>Hems for your skirt and dress</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08g.jpg" alt="Marking a hem" width="405" height="308" />
</div>
<p>1. Use a yardstick or other device to
measure the distance you want your skirt
from the floor. Mark with pins, about 3
inches apart around the skirt.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08h.jpg" alt="Folding and pinning a hem" width="470" height="284" />
</div>
<p>2. Fold along the pin-line. Pin and baste
along edges of hem. Pin top of hem to skirt.</p>
<p>3. Try the dress on to check length and
evenness of hem.</p>
<p>4. Trim hem to desired width. The width
of the hem is determined by weight of fabric
and fullness of skirt.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="Hem of circular skirt" width="468" height="230" />
</div>
<p>5. In circular skirts the top of the hem
is always much fuller than the bottom of the
hem. To avoid a bulge, draw this fullness
to lie flat against the skirt. Lengthen the
stitch on the machine and sew around top
of the hem &frac14; inch from the edge. Place another
row of stitches &frac14; inch from the first
row. Pin the seams and centers of panels
and draw the bobbin thread until the top
part of hem is only slightly larger than the
skirt. Ease in the fullness. This step is not
necessary on straight skirts.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09b.jpg" alt="Stitching a hem" width="433" height="197" />
</div>
<p>6. Make a &frac14;-inch fold at the top of the
hem. Machine stitch along edge. Pin and
baste in place. Hem on the machine or by
hand. Use matching thread.</p>
<h3 id="xc9">Blind hemming</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09c.jpg" alt="Blind hemming" width="426" height="246" />
</div>
<p>1. Fasten thread securely in the hem.</p>
<p>2. Take a stitch directly across from the
spot where you first placed your thread.
Then take a &frac12;-inch stitch through the top of
the hem.</p>
<p>3. Take a stitch in the skirt in the same
spot where you pulled needle from the hem.</p>
<p>4. Repeat for each stitch.</p>
<p>This stitch hides the threads in hem and
wears well.</p>
<h3 id="xc10">Choose fastenings you can make yourself</h3>
<p>What type of fasteners does your pattern
suggest? You have skill enough now to make
any one of several types. Remember, choose
the kind of fasteners you can make yourself
and do them the very best you can.</p>
<p>You have already learned the method of
sewing on buttons, snaps, and hooks and
eyes. If you use any of the fasteners, sew
them on securely. See Phase 2. Make your
buttonholes with a machine attachment.</p>
<p>A zipper may be necessary if you make a
dress. Read the instructions that come with
your zipper and study your pattern for help
in putting it in your dress.</p>
<h3 id="xc11">Belt keepers</h3>
<p>You might like to put belt loops on your
dress at the side seam if your dress has a belt.
Worked loops are fun to make.</p>

<p>1. Use matching double thread.</p>
<p>2. Hold the belt in place on dress and
loop thread back and forth across it three or
four times. Take a knot stitch each time you
sew into fabric.</p>
<p>3. Remove the belt.</p>
<p>4. Work across the threads with blanket
stitch. Keep stitches close together.</p>
<p>Select a belt for your dress at your local
store or have one made to match your dress.
You will learn to make belts when you have
had more experience in sewing.</p>

<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">Complete your record book</span></h2>
<p>Your record book is important. Are you
enjoying keeping a record of the things you
make and do? Have you recorded the articles
you have made? Have you recorded the activities
you have participated in on your permanent
record? How complete is this chapter
of your 4-H Club story? Are there other
things you should add&mdash;while you can still
remember?</p>
<p>Are you keeping a scrapbook of pictures
and newspaper clippings to round-out your
4-H Club story? Are you keeping other kinds
of things such as certificates and ribbons in
your scrapbook? If you belong to more than
one club are you keeping all of the things
that have to do with each project together?</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">Show others what you have learned</span></h2>
<h3 class="inline" id="c26">Exhibits</h3>
<p>Showing others what you have made can
be fun. Plan with your club to have a display
for your mothers and fathers. Share with
them the things you have learned in making
your projects. If you exhibit at the fair your
exhibit will be the main article you made.
Be sure that it is clearly labeled so that
it can be returned to you.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c27">Give a demonstration</h3>
<p>There are many opportunities to share
the things you have learned with others by
giving demonstrations. Watch for these opportunities&mdash;other
than your club meetings.</p>
<p>Select one of the demonstrations you
prepared for your club or prepare a new one.
Here are a few suggestions from which you
might choose.</p>
